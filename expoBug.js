This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project, specifically during the build process. The exact cause can vary, but it often relates to misconfigurations within the project setup, such as incorrect dependencies, missing native modules, or conflicts between packages.  It can manifest in different ways, from build failures to runtime errors on a device or simulator. For example, an error message might indicate issues with building specific native modules, problems linking libraries, or inconsistencies in the project's configuration files such as `app.json` or `package.json`. Sometimes, the error is vague and doesn't directly point to the root cause, making debugging challenging.
