The solution often involves a careful review of the project's `package.json` and `app.json` files. Check for dependency conflicts or missing packages. Examine the Expo documentation to ensure the project is correctly configured. For instance, verify that any native modules are properly linked and that versions are compatible. Sometimes, removing `node_modules` and reinstalling dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install` can help. If you suspect a dependency conflict, try updating dependencies or using a version range to make them compatible. Finally, check any custom native modules to ensure they are correctly integrated and configured for your project.
